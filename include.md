### A look at US Cocaine Seizures

This application presents statistics related to cocaine seizures of a known weight in each of the 50 US states during year 2007. The data comes from DEA's **STRIDE**, the System to Retrieve Information from Drug Evidence; the dataset contains 5 variables (state in which the seizure took place, purity of the drug expressed as a percentage, weight of the seizure in grams, month in which the seizure occurred and estimated value of the seizure in USD.) and 3380 observations. 

This application shows average cocaine purity (%), total weight (grams) and total value (US$) by US state as a function of the month during which the seizures were made. The source code for this application can be found in [GitHub](https://github.com/jmalbornoz/developing-data-products-project).
